Hello everyone!

I'm a recent masters graduate with a passion in data science and analytics.
Here you will find some of my projects in multiple coding languages, including
but not limited to, python, R, SQL, SAS, and Tableau. My resume can be downloaded
from the repository section. 

Cheers,
Camille Kirongozi
